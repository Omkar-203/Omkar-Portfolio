                        Image steganography is a technique used to hide confidential information within image files, making it undetectable to the naked eye. This process involves encoding the secret message into the least significant bits of the image pixels. It is widely used for secure communication and data protection in cybersecurity, ensuring that sensitive data remains concealed.
